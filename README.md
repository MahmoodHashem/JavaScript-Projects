4. **Temprature Converter**
   This project aims to create a temperature converter. The final version of the project includes three inputs for Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin temperature formats. When you change any of these inputs, for example, if you choose 100 degrees Celsius, you will see the equivalent Celsius value in Fahrenheit and Kelvin formats. Additionally, if you change one input, you will see a real-time change inside the other inputs.
